The system is built on the following modular components:


- **Beacon Devices**: ESP32-based mobile hardware units equipped with WiFi capabilities that broadcast and receive signals for position tracking. [View Repository](https://github.com/BeaconBlink/Pager)
- **Server Deployment**: Server based infrastracture along with the database, containarized with Docker [View Repository](https://github.com/BeaconBlink/Deployment)
  - **Main server and web application**: NodeJS main server responsible for orchestrating data flow between components, along with Web Application for the user [View Repository](https://github.com/BeaconBlink/Server)
  - **Mapping" server running alongside a machine learning module**: Python server responsible for communication between the SciKitLearn Machine Learning Module and other components [View Repository](https://github.com/BeaconBlink/Room_mapping)

Each module communicates through RESTful APIs.
